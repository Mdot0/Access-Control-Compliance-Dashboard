**Access Control Compliance Dashboard**
A Python-powered dashboard to map MITRE ATT&CK techniques to NIST 800-53 and other compliance frameworks for faster audits and better visibility into security posture.

üîç Why This Project?

Compliance audits are time-consuming and complex. Security teams often struggle to align real-world adversary behaviors (MITRE ATT&CK) with compliance requirements (NIST, ISO).
This tool bridges that gap by automating the mapping and giving security professionals a dashboard to see:

1. Which ATT&CK techniques they detect
2. Which NIST controls those techniques map to
3. Where compliance gaps exist

‚ö° Features

‚úÖ Pulls live MITRE ATT&CK framework data

‚úÖ Maps ATT&CK techniques to NIST 800-53 Rev 5 (via official crosswalk)

‚úÖ Exports results to CSV/Excel for audit use

‚úÖ Interactive dashboard for filtering by Technique, Control, or Framework

‚úÖ Modular design to extend mappings (ISO 27001, CIS, etc.)
